* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Assignment_1)

The main focus of Assignment 1 was applying Binary Logistic Regression models to discrete responses data sets. These models were then interpreted using residual diagnostics, confidence intervals, likelihood ratio tests, as well as odds ratios.

* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Assignment_2)

The main focus of Assignment 2 was implementing multinomial regression models on categorical response data sets. The results were then analyzed through explatory data analysis, confidence intervals, likelihood ratios tests, as well as odds ratios.

* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Assignment_3)

The main focus of Assignment 3 was to apply different time series analysis techniques. These methods included linear modeling, ARIMA modeling, model averageing, cross-validation, and vector autoregression. Then, each model was able to generate predictive forcasts for the time series.

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Lab_1)

The main focus of Lab 1 was to conduct discrete analysis on the failed Challenger Space Shuttle disaster. The analysis included exploratory data analysis, data augmentation, binary logistic regression, model comparisons, and likelihood ratio tests. 

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Lab_2)

The main focus of Lab 2 was to perform a time series analysis of the global CO2 levels over time. This investigation applied series decomposition, ACF/PACF interpretation, linear modeling, ARIMA modeling, as well as predictive forecasting. 

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Lab_3)

The main focus of Lab 3 was to analyze the rate of U.S. driving fatalities and its contributing factors. The methods used to perform the analysis were pooled OLS, fixed effects, and random effects modeling. 

*All of these projects were completed for UCB's Master of Data Science Course W271 - Statistical Methods for Discrete Response, Time Series, and Panel Data. These were completed using RStudio.*
