# Statistical Methods for Discrete Response, Time Series, & Panel Data

## Erin Werner

Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics dealing with data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation. A discrete response is a statistical distribution that shows the probabilities of discrete (countable) outcomes. Additionally, time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis. Time series data means that data is in a series of particular time periods or intervals. Lastly, panel data is multi-dimensional data involving measurements of the same subject over time. Panel data can detect and measure statistical effects that pure time series or cross-sectional data can't. Each of these subjects require their own particular analysis and modeling techniques.

The [projects](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects) in this repository will cover the different aspects within the field of statistical methods for discrete response, time series, or panel data, such as
