Data Analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions and supporting decision-making. Data analytics is used in business to help organizations make better business decisions. Data-driven businesses make decisions based on data, which means they can be more confident that their actions will bring success since there is data to support them.
