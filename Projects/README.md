* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Assignment_1)

The main focus of Project 1 is MNIST digit classification with KNN and Naive Bayes. These topics are explored by tuning the hyperparameters, applying different normalization techniques, and generating new samples. The models are optimized by testing for accuracy.

* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Assignment_2)

The main focus of Project 2 is topic classification. This is achieved by using both CountVectorizer and TFIDF methods to preprocess the text data. Logistic regression models are then trained on the vectorized results in order to determine accuracy. 

* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Assignment_3)

The main focus of Project 3 is classification through the means of dimensionality reduction. The main methods used in this example are Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). K-Means models are then trained on the reduced results in order to optimize the hyperparameters and determine accuracy.

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Lab_1)

The main focus of the Final Project was to improve the Amazon Fine Foods marketplace experience by helping both consumers and retailers glean better insights on the items they buy or sell. It was a group project in which we intended to leverage machine learning algorithms in order to provide services that would benefit both ends of the marketplace. My main personal contribution was the recommender system.

* [Lab 2](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Lab_2)

* [Lab 3](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Time_Series/tree/main/Projects/Lab_3)

*All of these projects were completed for UCB's Master of Data Science Course W271 - Statistical Methods for Discrete Response, Time Series, and Panel Data. These were completed using RStudio.*
